# gradient

## Linear gradient

Linear gradients transition colors progressively along an imaginary line. They are generated with the linear-gradient() function.

- to top: 0deg
- to bottom: 180deg（默认）
- to left: 270deg
- to right: 90deg

## Radial gradient

Radial gradients transition colors progressively from a center point (origin). They are generated with the radial-gradient() function.

## Conic gradient

Conic gradients transition colors progressively around a circle. They are generated with the conic-gradient() function.

## Repeating gradient

Repeating gradients duplicate a gradient as much as necessary to fill a given area. They are generated with the repeating-linear-gradient(), repeating-radial-gradient(), and repeating-conic-gradient() functions.
